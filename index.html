        <h2>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</h2>
        <p class="bio"><strong>Shinzo Abe</strong> the longest-serving Japanese prime minister, who made it his political mission to vanquish his countryâ€™s wartime ghosts but fell short of his ultimate goal of restoring Japan as a normalized military power, was assassinated on Friday in the city of Nara, Japan. He was 67. <br><br>

            His death, from injuries sustained in a shooting during a speech at a campaign event, was confirmed by Dr. Hidetada Fukushima, professor in charge of emergency medicine at Nara Medical University Hospital. <br><br>
            
            Mr. Abe, the scion of a staunchly nationalist family of politicians that included a grandfather who was accused of war crimes before becoming prime minister, made history by leading Japan for nearly eight consecutive years, beginning in 2012.
            But that longevity stood out in a country that had five leaders in as many years before his return and is now on its second prime minister since Abe stepped down.
